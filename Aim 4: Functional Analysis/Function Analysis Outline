#### Aim 4: Explore the effect of H. pylori and Fusobacteria abundance on the functional diversity of the gastric mucosa microbiome during gastric cancer disease progression ####
4A. Install PICRUSt2 (39), generate metabolic data by running preliminary pipeline using filtered metadata (from 1F) for predicting functional potential of community members 
4B. Run PICRUSt2 pipeline analysis based on new columns combining disease stage with H. pylori or Fusobacterium abundance
4C. Produce tables of top 10 up-represented and top 10 down-represented metabolic pathways on R between grouping
4D. Produce heatmap and volcano plot visualizations of pathway representation on R
4E. Evaluate identified pathways between groups and perform statistical analysis on R to identify significant associations
