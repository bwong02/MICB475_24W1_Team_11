#### Aim 1: Reclassify samples based on H. pylori and Fusobacterium abundance within the gastric mucosa microbiome ####
1A. Import raw data and demultiplex using QIIME2 (38)
1B. Quality control denoising and cluster data using QIIME2 to generate feature table and representative sequences
1C. Train classifier, perform taxonomic analysis and taxonomy-based filtering to remove non-bacterial sequences and generate phylogenetic tree of ASVs (Phyloseq Objects)
1D. Make rarefaction curve, then apply determined sampling depth rarefaction using QIIME2
1E. Classify samples with regard to H. pylori and Fusobacterium abundance as “undetectable”, “low”, or “high” and add to metadata table as 2 new columns on R
1F. Wrangle data with regards to H. pylori and Fusobacterium abundance and disease stage, creating 3 new columns (2 combining individual bacterium abundance and disease stage, and 1 combining all three states)
