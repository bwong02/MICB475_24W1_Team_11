# Meeting Minutes and Agenda

## October 3, 2024

### Agenda

- Go through proposed papers and databases to decide on one to move forward with
- Brainstorm research question depending on final database chosen

### Meeting Minutes

2 Paper Choices: Gastrointestinal Cancer or Breast Cancer
- Breast Cancer does not have much metadata on the cancer patients
- **CHOSE GASTROINTESTINAL CANCER DATA**

Research Questions Brainstorm
- 2 question routes:
  - Taxonomic route: what species or communities exist or is associated with something
  - Functional route: predict what metabolic pathways exist in those communities
- How does H. pylori affect the microbiome community?
- Look at H. pylori both taxonomically and functionally?
- Is H. pylori associated with different histopathology stages?
- BEFORE MAKING A RESEARCH QUESTION, MAKE A CORRELATION PLOT OR CREATE A NEW METADATA CATEGORY (go with group and H. pylori positive/negative like HC+, HC-, CG+, CG-, etc.)

Next Steps
1. Create a column with the Group + H. pylori status - Nicholas
2. Make heat map comparing the different categories (UJEMI+ anemia group did a heat map) - Miles
4. Outline proposal before next meeting (aims and research question) - McKenna, Brandon, Gabi
5. Find background papers that discuss H. pylori, cancer, and microbiome
6. Eventually check with Hans if trimming or denoising is appropriate 

Other Notes:
 - If we find an non-annotated ASV, we can BLAST it
 - Finding an ASV does not mean it is biologically significant in the community




## October 10, 2024

### Agenda
**1. Discuss research question and specific project aims.**
- Potential questions:
  - Is there a difference in microbiome diversity and function comparing  +/- H. pylori status within and between disease stages of gastric cancer?
- Our thoughts/questions 
  - Is this okay for us to move forward with H. pylori analysis, even though they also examined
      
**2. Discuss project rational (discuss heat map, etc...)**
- Rationale: created a heat map looking at (+/-) HP samples in each stage:
- We noticed little difference between collection sites, which led us to look into differences between groups and not distinguish 
      between collection sites. 
- We noticed a difference in relative percentages between groups
- We discussed looking into differences between subtypes within each stage but decided against it due to sample constraints. 
- The heatmap is located in the R folder already. The R project and script file are also there. 

**3. Discuss project aims** 
Aim 1: Is there an H. Pylori status difference between different sites within a disease stage (supported by heat map)?
Aim 2: Does H. pylori status and disease stage affect beta diversity and microbiome taxonomy?
Aim 3: What functional differences exist between the communities at each disease stage and between disease stages? 

**4. Go through our qiime2 workflow** 
- Trimming, rarefaction, diversity plots, etc...
