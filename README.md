# Meeting Minutes and Agenda

## October 3, 2024

### Agenda

- Go through proposed papers and databases to decide on one to move forward with
- Brainstorm research question depending on final database chosen

### Meeting Minutes

2 Paper Choices: Gastrointestinal Cancer or Breast Cancer
- Breast Cancer does not have much metadata on the cancer patients
- **CHOSE GASTROINTESTINAL CANCER DATA**

Research Questions Brainstorm
- 2 question routes:
  - Taxonomic route: what species or communities exist or is associated with something
  - Functional route: predict what metabolic pathways exist in those communities
- How does H. pylori affect the microbiome community?
- Look at H. pylori both taxonomically and functionally?
- Is H. pylori associated with different histopathology stages?
- BEFORE MAKING A RESEARCH QUESTION, MAKE A CORRELATION PLOT OR CREATE A NEW METADATA CATEGORY (go with group and H. pylori positive/negative like HC+, HC-, CG+, CG-, etc.)

Next Steps
1. Create a column with the Group + H. pylori status - Nicholas
2. Make heat map comparing the different categories (UJEMI+ anemia group did a heat map) - Miles
4. Outline proposal before next meeting (aims and research question) - McKenna, Brandon, Gabi
5. Eventually check with Hans if trimming or denoising is appropriate 

Other Notes:
 - If we find an non-annotated ASV, we can BLAST it
 - Finding an ASV does not mean it is biologically significant in the community
